This is a podcast test. 

Hi everyone, so this is the inagural podcast of the ____ show. I'll be interviewing friends and musicians to hear what their latest favorite music is and what they've been listening to for a long time. Unfortunately, we can't put the actual music into the show, otherwise I'd be breaking copywright law. So what'll be asked of you is to click on the Soundcloud widget to hear mindless banter and then listen to the song with the Spotify widget.
